//This code demonstrates a basic Expo app (bug.js)
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

// This file (bugSolution.js) contains steps to troubleshoot the error. No code changes are required in the main app. Instead, focus on environment fixes:

1. **Verify Android Studio and SDK Installation:** Ensure Android Studio is properly installed and configured. Check that the Android SDK is correctly set up and that you have the necessary build tools and platforms installed.
2. **Restart Emulator and Devices:** Try restarting your Android emulator or physical device.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  In some cases, cleaning and rebuilding your project can resolve issues. (Use Expo CLI commands to clean and then build again).
4. **Check for System Conflicts:** Ensure there are no conflicts between Expo CLI and other software running in the background.
5. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** In Android Studio, you might need to Invalidate Caches/Restart to clear any temporary files that may be causing issues.
6. **Update SDK Components:** Check for updates to the Android SDK components and update them if necessary. 
7. **Update Expo CLI:** Try running `expo upgrade` to update to the latest version of the Expo CLI.
8. **Check Log Files:** Review logs from Android Studio, Expo CLI, or other related tools to get a better understanding of the error. 
9. **Create New Emulator:** If possible, try creating a new, fresh emulator instance to rule out emulator-specific problems.
10. **Examine Permissions:** Ensure your project has the necessary permissions.
